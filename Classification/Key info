# Steps for classification:
#1. Data preparation #Load data #View data
#2. Extract sentiment #Define which sentiment to include #Set the positive or negative sentiment based on coeffieicient
#3. Split data in to training and test sets
#4. Train a sentiment classifier with logistic regression #Out put- #of features #of coefficients #of classes #positive coeefiicent/negative coefficients


# TO improve model:
To improve it, consider doing one of the following:
(a) Increasing the regularization.
(b) Standardizing the input data.
(c) Removing highly correlated features.
(d) Removing `inf` and `NaN` values in the training data.
